/*
Pivot table SQL code.
Author: Alex Christsensen

This code builds the summary table that is required by the PivotTableCode_Python file. It is all of the study participants and all 
of their 1080 run dates and metrics.

Because the PivotTableCode_Python calculates the dataframe differences using only the original values, the columns that are most 
important are name, datetime, concentric_load, peak_power, peak_force, peak_speed, average_power, average_force, average_speed.
The "difference" columns are not used directly and are more for reference.
